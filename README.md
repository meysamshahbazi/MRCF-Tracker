# Demonstration running instructions

>Running demonstration of this tracker is very easy so long as you have MATLAB. Just download the package, extract it and follow two steps:
>
>1. Config seq name in `configSeqs_demo_for_RVCA.m`,
>
>2. Run `RVCA_Demo_single_seq.m`,
>   and the RVCA Demo should be running.
